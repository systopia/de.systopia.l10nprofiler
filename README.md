# Localisation Profiler Extension

This extension allows you to live-capture ongoing translations and 
export those as .PO and .POT files, so you can easily create 
or amend the existing translation with your own.

After translation, you can inject the resulting .MO file using 
SYSTOPIA's [Custom MO extension](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.l10nmo).
